		- Questions
		  collapsed:: true
			- Input training data are vectors of voltage magnitudes and angles (load and PV profiles) etc. that are obtained through powerflow analysis, so the structure of the network still has to be known to generate the training set?
				- -> Not modelfree?
				- No topology identification?
			- Why does longest path method work best?

- Questions
	- Intro chapters
		- Penetration of EV-PV (DER) -> effect on LV network constraints?
			- Distinction between different LV grids
				- Geography, function
			- Different penetration levels
		- -> It is vital to know HC -> different ways to calculate HCA
			- Traditional
				- Deterministic
				  collapsed:: true
					- Traditional HCA methods
					  collapsed:: true
						- ((654772cd-b79b-42f2-ac92-6b2fb27441ed))
					- The deterministic method obtains an optimal solution on a single scenario, usually the worst-case scenario(s)
				- Stochastic
				  collapsed:: true
					- probabilistic techniques, e.g., Monte Carlo simulation, model the uncertainties in the power system
				- ICA
				  collapsed:: true
					- Differently, using historical time-series data, the streamlined method [22] and the iterative ICA [23], [24] method provide insight into how hosting capacity changes over time and the ability to derive a corresponding hosting capacity pattern subjected to time
			- Machine learning based solution
	- Only evaluation?
		- Evaluate traditional vs ML
		- Evaluate different ML algos
		- Evaluate in which dimensions?
			- Accuracy (computed vs actual HC)
			- Amount of network/bus violations (overvoltages etc.)
			- Computational burden
		- Evaluate different approaches
			- e.g. different Deep learning algorithms
				- Which hyperparameters are most important?
				- Algorithm selection
	- Implementation?
		- For what part will I have to dig into code? (github etc.)
		- How is it/can it be integrated in Smart meters?
