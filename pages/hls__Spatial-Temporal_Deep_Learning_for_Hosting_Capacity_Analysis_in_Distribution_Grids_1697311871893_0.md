- A random traversal in the network will result in wrong spatial correlation. Thus, to convert the network into a spatial sequence, we propose traversing the network with paths. This method divides the distribution grid into different paths, from the slack bus or three-phase main trunk to each lateral end.

- Therefore, we modiﬁed this gate to dual forget gates. The dual forget gates are designed to decide what information the cell should memorize from these two dimensions. Consequently, one new cell can receive the cell states and hidden states from the last temporal cell and the last spatial cell separately.
