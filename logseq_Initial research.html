    <li>HC</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The HC of combined EV-PV in the distribution system refers to the maximum amount of EVs and PVs that can be integrated into the low-voltage grid without exceeding the system security indices</li>

    <li>Research question</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The use of smart meters has the potential to revolutionize the distribution system by enabling real-time monitoring of system variables and providing a large amount of data to system operators. This abundance of data can be used to overcome the shortcomings of current HC analysis methods by investigating data-driven approaches that can map power flow data to the combined hosting capacity of EVs and PVs. By leveraging historical data, it is possible to estimate the combined hosting capacity without having to calculate power flow [3]. The proposed machine learning approach should consider the spatial-temporal effects of EVPV and capture the correlation between them in determining the combined hosting capacity. A strong background in machine learning, particularly deep learning, and distribution power system analysis is necessary for this research.</li>

      <li>Summary</li>
      <ul>
        <li>his paper proposes a scalable electrical model-free voltage calculation methodology that uses Neural Networks to capture the underlying relationships among historical smart meter data (P, Q, and V) and the corresponding LV network.</li>
        <li>Results considering different weeks with the same and higher PV penetrations demonstrate an average error of less than 2 Volts; showing that, in the absence of LV electrical models, the methodology could be used by distribution companies for different applications</li>
        <li>This paper proposes a scalable methodology based on nonlinear regressions, speciﬁcally using Neural Networks (NNs), to calculate voltages without electrical models</li>
        <li>NN selection</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Therefore, the hyperparameters that are found to be the most suitable for a particular LV network will not work when using another LV network with different characteristics. Consequently, a scalable methodology to ﬁnd the most suitable NNs (i.e., NN∗ and MNN∗) is crucial so the same recipe can be applied by distribution companies on any type or size of LV network.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Abstract</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In this paper, the impact of Electric Vehicle (EV) uncontrolled charging with four levels of EV penetration in overall 21 real low voltage distribution grids in two seasons are analysed.</li>
          <li>Three key congestion indicators, the transformer loading, line loading and node voltage as well as several other evaluation indexes are studied</li>
          <li>The results reveal that the majority of the simulated grids had no or minor moments of mild overloading while the rest grids had critical issues. Among all the grids, suburban grids are most vulnerable to massive EV integration. Out of the evaluated grids, those who are located in Germany have the highest redundancy for high EV penetration accommodation. Overall, the impact of uncontrolled EV charging depends on the combination of EV charging demand as well as the grid inherent features.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Literature review</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The inﬂuence of data-driven uncertainties in driver behaviour and energy demand of the EVs toward the grid impact of uncontrolled charging is considered in [3], [4], [12], [13].</li>
          <li>How does Monte Carlo simulation of EV impact work?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Researchers of [22], [23] ran a plentiful of Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the EV charging impact of 0-100% penetration levels on two real British LV distribution grids whose grid types are not speciﬁed</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Focus</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The focus of this paper is to use measured probabilistic data pertaining to energy demand, arrival and departure time of EVs to investigate the impact of uncontrolled charging for several actual grids in Europe.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Grid data</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Since EV penetration is assumed proportional to the Nhh in this paper, it can be inferred that an increase in serviced EVs for the given penetration level will be maximum for the SUB functional category.</li>
